**Brand and Product Emotions sentiment Analysis**

**Business problem**

Business entities are faced with stiff competition as ever before due to revolution in mass media and information technology. For a business entity to be competitive, an entity must satisfy the expectations of users and clients. This is done through brand reviews and user feedback through social media platforms such as Meta, X, and Instagram. In 2013, the Crowdflower Inc collected tweets about multiple brands and products. The users were asked to express their emotions whether the brand or product meet their expectations. The users expressed positive, negative and neutral (no emotion towards a brand or product). 

This project aims to evaluate the users’ sentiments using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will study the emotions hashtags and present visualisations on emotions that dominate the reviews, the most appraised brands. The project will use various python libraries for data preprocessing, cleaning, visualisation and modelling. 



**Objectives**

•	Identify and classify sentiment of tweets (positive, negative, or neutral) as directed at the various brands or products.

•	Track and manage the reputation of brands and products by analysing the emotions expressed in tweets.

•	Gather customer feedback and experiences related to the brands or products.

•	Gather insights into customer preferences and opinions about different products or brands.
